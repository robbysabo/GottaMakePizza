    ** Arcade_Game.cs **
    - Adjust Gameover condition for ratings, maybe (Max ratings = 6, with 2.5 start) NEEDS TESTING
    - Fix ticket rating with the timer, seems to not work and resets after first timer (green to yellow timer).

    ** Story (Optional) **
    - Begin making the Story Mode (Need Arcade mode to be complete before starting)
